        need that I write unto you.</strong> When these things are going to happen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a 
        thief in the night.</strong> Oh, I thought the whole world was going to see him. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">For when they shall say, Peace and safety;</strong> He is giving us 
        signs now. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</strong> And that is all you 
        hear, is peace, peace, peace, peace, peace.  Amen and everybody is running for a hiding place, or searching for one and cannot find one, and all of the time God is the only hiding place 
        there is.  The Word says so. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, 
        and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</strong> So we are not the children of darkness, we are the children of light, and they cannot sneak up on us if 
        we know the Word of God, Amen, and know the Spirit.</p>

        man,</strong> If you covet everything, then you are just in the same place as if you went out and slept with a whore.  He does not make any difference. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</strong> Now you can be forgiven if you have done these things.  
        Praise God.  I thank God for the blood that forgives us from all sin, all sin, all sin, Amen.  There is not a sin that the blood does not cover.  Praise God, isn't it wonderful?  If we 
        ask for forgiveness, we are forgiven. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of 
        disobedience.</strong> Because of the things that men do, and women. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</strong> Now you are saved.  Do not get 
        tangled up in that kind of stuff. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: (For the fruit of the

        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done 
        of them in secret. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</strong> But all things that are rebuked, that God 
        rebukes, when the light comes, it manifests it.  When we show them their error, then they see the light and the evil is brought to them in a light, that they can understand what 
        they have done.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,</strong> He says you are like you are dead.

        Amen. <strong class="w3-text-red">This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</strong> Do you get that?  It is pretty plain isn't it?  
        Could you get it any plainer than that?  How many times has he said it today? <strong class="w3-text-red">I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this 
        bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</strong> That the curse would be completely done away with; that 
        the last enemy to be destroyed is death.  Now the scripture says that.  Death is an enemy.  And that is the last thing that is going to happen, when death is completely done away 
        with.</p>

        of these scriptures.  He is not talking about the resurrection and life eternally afterwards.  He is talking about now, the present time, that we can receive this.  Praise God.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">If this people does not believe what they are hearing, there is no hope for us.  We have heard the good word, the same as the children of Israel heard the word, but 
        they did not believe it, and we can cast it off, but I am not going to cast it off.  I am going to live, kids.  Amen.  I am going to believe the Word of God.  I believe it.  He spoke 
        to me personally and said I would never see death.  Amen, I mean it.  We know we are in the last days, and that is when he said it would take place.  I am going to hang onto it,

        foundation of the world?  Before the foundation of the world, we were with the Father.  We were called before the foundation of the world.  Amen, and we were with him before the 
        foundation.  We are in his plan the same as Christ.  Everything was foretold ahead, before him.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-red">As thou hast given him power </strong> Christ 
        <strong class="w3-text-red">over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</strong> Speaking of the Father. 
        <strong class="w3-text-red"> And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. I have glorified thee</strong> He is praying 
        to the Father. <strong class="w3-text-red">I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own 
        self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</strong> Did you know that that same glory that was in his first Son is reserved…well I better not get out too far or 
        somebody is going to buck up to this one.  Anyway, you know what I was about to say, Amen, we are promised that glory.  Amen.  We come out of the Father, too.  He is the Father of 
        glory.  Well, if we were in him before the foundation of the world, praise God anyway.</p>

        thou hast given me; for they are thine.</strong> Who do we belong to? The Father. <strong class="w3-text-red">And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come 
        to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.</strong> Now look, first he said that we would be kept in Jesus' name, 
        Amen, but he is talking about a different group here.  He says, "Father, you keep them through your own name, those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one."  That is a special 
        group.  They are not just the saved, the redeemed of the earth, that will be the servants of the Lord in the kingdom. But there are some that are going to be one with the Father, 
        doing exactly the same thing, exactly the same honor, exactly the same power as the Father and the Son. One. You cannot separate them. You cannot separate Jesus from the Father.  
        They are one.  And this was his prayer that he would have a people that would be one with him, Amen.</p>

        For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</strong>He does not mean that we are dead physically, but as far as the world is concerned, this group is dead to the things 
        of the world, Amen, because the rest of the scriptures prove this here.  Our life is hid with Christ in God.  We are as though we were dead.  Our life is hid with Christ in God. </p>

        won't go any farther, because we’ll get right on back into another teaching. He’s saying, 'When Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory' with 
        this glorified precious life, no more sin, never to be tempted, death gone, hallelujah, and to take the world for God.  And we will have the power to do it.  Praise God.Do you want to 
        still settle for just being forgiven for your sins?  You can if you want to. I do not want to.  I want to rule and reign with Jesus Christ. It is a great truth.  And I am living it.  
        Praise God.  I do not care what anybody says, I have made that statement many times, "I am eternal, Lord.  You made me eternal."  I have no intention of dying, not that I care.  What 
        is death?  One step.  It does not mean anything to me if he would want to take me in death, but I am no good to him dead.  Amen, we are no good to him dead lying out there rotting in 
        the grave.  What good are we to God out there?  We are good for nothing.  Our work is finished.  Praise God, it is the live ones he is looking for.</p>    
   

    <p class="w3-justify">We have been told enough today so that we know we do not have to die.  There is no reason for dying.  There is no reason for dying if we will walk the way God tells 
        us to walk and eliminate sin, because remember, death came by sin.  Sin was the cause of death.  Get that embedded in your heart.  When sin is gone, you are not going to die because 
        the curse is gone.  We have to live.</p>

        with power: That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
