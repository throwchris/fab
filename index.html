    <p class="w3-justify">Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the kingdom.  Sin brought a change in their (Adam and Eve) flesh or they could not have died.  Adam was made an eternal being.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>1 Corinthians 15:50</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot 
        inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. </strong> What is a glorified body, like Jesus after he rose from the dead?  Now remember, he is our pattern 
        and he will have a people exactly as he is now, and we know that this mortal must put on immortality.  This is a mortal body, a flesh body.  That is what mortal is.  It is a flesh 
        body.  It must put on immortality so that it can never die, so that it can never be sick and all of these good things.  I just wonder what kind of a change must come over the body, 
        because during the transfiguration when Jesus was transfigured, even his raiment was changed.  He was glowing like just a transcendent glow on him, yet he was still a flesh body.  
        He was not glorified at that time.  He just – by the Spirit – had cleansed himself of all: overcome all the desires and so forth of the flesh.  So we know that the transfiguration 
        was not the glorified body because he died after that, and once you are glorified, you cannot be killed because that body won’t die.  That is a body that cannot die, the glorified 
        body.  We know that all through the scriptures that he tells that he will do this to a people: that they will receive a glorified body.</p>
  

    <p class="w3-justify">When Jesus walked down to the seashore, he had been up praying all night long.  He had been praying to the Father all night and he walked down to the seashore.  
        This was in his natural flesh body just like all of us.  The disciples had gone out in a ship and were out in a storm.  It was quite a storm.  It says the winds were boisterous.  It 
        was evidently in the middle of the night and evidently the Father told him to walk on that water out to the ship.  He must have had quite a way to go because it was out in the sea.  
        The ship was out there, so he starts walking on the water.  That is what you call faith.  He had to believe every word the Father spoke to him, which we do not.  That is our trouble.  
        We do not believe as we ought to believe.  If the Lord would tell us to go walk on the water, we would just say, “Oh, that was not God.”  Right?  But he did everything that the Father 
        spoke to him.  Did you know that they had to follow the same Spirit that we are following right now?  Only he was absolutely obedient to the Spirit and did everything that the Lord told 
        him to do, and had complete faith to believe it.  This is the way he overcame.  And he has told us that we can overcome, because he has overcome.</p> 
        
        <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 1</p>    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">In the first place, we think that he was something a lot different than what he really was.  He wet his pants just like the rest of the kids.  Do you realize that?  
        That is kind of hard for you to believe.  We have him up on such a high plane; this is why we do not have the relationship that we should have with him.  Sure, we know that he was God 
        in the flesh, but God says he dwells in our flesh too, didn’t he?  Are you catching me?  Isn’t that what he said?  He said, “The Father and I will come in and set up our abode in your 
        heart.”  And he said, “The kingdom of God is without observation.”  You cannot see it, because the kingdom of God is within, in the hearts of man.  Right?  I do not know if I am going 
        to make you understand what I am feeling.  I do not see how I can, because it is hard to put it in words.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">We limit God.  That is what the children of Israel did, and that is why they could not go in.  Amen.  And I tell you, we are stepping out to possess a much greater 
        land than the children of Israel ever possessed.  The giants are bigger too – the giants of unbelief and criticism and all of those good things.  But nevertheless, it does not change 
        the Word of God.  There is a people that is going to come forth in his likeness and in his image and in his full stature.  Is that the Word of God?  And he says, “Greater works than 
        these shall ye do because I go to my Father.”  He completed his work.  He made the way.  He overcame all the bounds of the flesh, all those things that bound him from being the complete 
        Son.  He was bound because he walked in a flesh body. And yet it says that he came in the image of the Father.  And Jesus came to represent the Father in the earth.  And so God was in 
        him.  Amen.  Well, God is in us.  What is the matter with us?  Unbelief.  Unbelief.  Absolutely unbelief.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">As he walked out on the water and got into the ship, when he started coming, they got scared because they thought he was a ghost.  Now here he was in a flesh body just 
        like ours, but because he believed God, he walked.  Can’t you just see him walking on top of those waves?  Just walking on down.  Then when he got in the boat, Peter asked if he could 
        walk on the water too, and the Lord let him walk on the water.  We know for sure that he was a flesh man with all of his failures.  Amen.  Now we know for sure he was, right?  So what 
        is the matter with us?  But fear came in.  Fear.  He feared.  He was afraid and so he sank.  And this is why we sink, because we are afraid.  What I am trying to get you to understand 
        is that we are flesh bodies and we think that we cannot do anything until we become this great glorified body.  No.  That is not the truth.  The scripture is full of exploits that were 
        done.  What about Elijah when he prayed and the rains were shut off?  He did not even have the baptism of the Holy Ghost.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 2</p>   
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">What I want to try to get across and get you to understand is that this flesh and blood body, as we know it, cannot come into that realm that the Lord wants us to come 
        into.  God is the one who created flesh in the first place, and he created us, and he has made us this way.  But Adam and Eve were not made in the same way, before sin.  These things 
        entered in after sin.  Adam and Eve were made to live forever.  In other words, they were created in a glorified body until sin came in.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">When Jesus came back after being risen from the dead, he went to the seashore, cooked fish and ate with the disciples in the glorified body.  So what is the glorified 
        body?  He must still have had intestines and so on and so forth to digest food.  Amen.  You see we have made it to look like spooks out here.  It is not so.  He showed his hands to 
        Thomas and the hole in his side.  It was still flesh.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">I feel very highly privileged because the Lord years ago had shown me glorified flesh.  He showed me his hands.  I will never forget it, because it was the most 
        beautiful flesh.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">There is a birth just about to take place.  So hold your hats, kids and hang on, will you?  There is a birth of a son.  Jesus Christ will be manifested one of these 
        days in a way that you will be able to see it.  Amen.  Before something is born, you don’t see it too well, but when it is born, you get a look at it.  We are going on here, because 
        I am going to believe God.  And I am not going to hide all of this stuff.  It is time for us to start coming into this place Christ has made for us in his walk on this earth. Now I 
        know this is going to sound foreign to some of you, but hang on.  We will eventually catch on by the Spirit.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">So Jesus ate with a glorified body, yet he could also walk through a wall, because he walked right through the doors when they were locked and appeared unto Thomas.  
        So there is a change that is going to happen.  That sounds so mysterious to us.  It is nothing for God.  I told you about when he let my body disappear and it scared me almost to 
        death.  I saw the beads hanging out here with no body under it.  It scared me almost to death, but nevertheless it happened.  It was real.  And I do not know what the purpose of these 
        things is, only that I know he wanted me to know something.  How simple it is for him to do something like that  What I want to know is, what is the difference between the bodies that 
        we are walking around in now, and what change is going to take place?</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 3</p>    

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red">Genesis 2:23-24<strong></strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my 
        flesh:</strong> He did not say anything about blood.  He said ‘flesh and blood cannot inherit’. Jesus came back in a flesh and bone body.  The life is in the blood.  You certainly 
        understand that if they run out of blood, they are dead, aren’t they?  So the life is in the blood.  Our life – in our sinful life now – is blood.  In the beginning when the first man 
        and woman were formed, he said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh” and they were made to live forever.  And you know what the curse was.  When they sinned, then death 
        set in.  There was a body change.  There was a change in their bodies.  You see the Bible is made to be understood.  So the change came the minute they sinned and they became flesh and 
        blood and death started to set in and they eventually died.  So that change has to be the same kind of a change that took place in Adam and Eve when they sinned. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:</strong> Not flesh and blood. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">She shall be 
        called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. </strong> But not 
        flesh and blood. </p>    

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Sin brought a change in Adam and Eve in their flesh, or they could not have died.  They could have sinned and lived forever.  So he set the sword up there to keep 
        them from the tree of life.  There will also be a reverse action in our flesh so death will not have a hold upon us.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-light-blue">Matthew 19:5-6<strong></strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-red"> And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, 
        and shall cleave to his wife: and they</strong> Two, or <strong class="w3-text-red">twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath 
        joined together, let not man put asunder.</strong> Now he is also speaking here of us in our flesh and blood bodies.  God did not change that because of sin.  It is still the same.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red">1 Corinthians 6:15-16<strong></strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of

        Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. What? Know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? For two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</strong> So we are 
        responsible for what we do in these bodies.  We are responsible.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>1 Corinthians 6:19-20</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy 
        Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are 
        God's.</strong>You say, "I can go any place I want to go, and I can do anything I want to do, and if I want to curse and swear and blaspheme and do all of these things, I can do it if I 
        want to."  Oh no, you cannot, not and get by with it.  No.  You cannot do it.  You cannot do it.  It will catch up with you, believe me.  God will give you space to repent, but he can 
        drop you too, like a hot coal.  Amen.  We cannot, for he says, "For ye are bought with a price," the blood of Christ, as Christians.  We are bought with the blood of 
        Christ. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</strong> Our body and our spirit belong to God.  We have no claim 
        over them.  Let's quit treating it like we own it.  Amen.  And follow after the Lord.  Aren't you glad this is God's Word and not mine?  You would be so mad at me.  But it is God's 
        Word.</p>

        the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague. </strong> What the Lord is trying to show us with this scripture here is, 
        if you walk in the flesh, you can tell, because you will crave flesh things, but if you walk in the Spirit, your desire will be after spiritual things.</p>    
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">God was wanting to bring – through Moses – a people in to inherit the good land, the promised land, the place that God had prepared for his people.  And because of 
        their sinful desires or their flesh desires, they were dissatisfied and murmured and complained all of the way through until finally, they asked for meat, so he sent quail in.  The 
        ground was covered with quail.  And they caught them and killed them, and they were having a feast, flesh for flesh.  This was flesh and it was crying out for flesh.  Now there is 
        nothing wrong in eating quail or any other kind of flesh if God permits.  But I just say that their desire was there, instead of after God.  Their greatest desire (was their flesh and 
        satisfying it) and that is why they were complaining.  So he says, <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the 
        Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague.</strong> Not because they were eating quail, but because their desire was not to God to 
        fulfill his will, but to fulfill their own desires of their own flesh. This is God's order from the beginning. </p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Numbers 27:16-17</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man

        as sheep which have no shepherd.</strong> There have to be shepherds, but we cannot all be shepherds when we are coming in.  I do not know how many are going to be shepherds.  But there 
        has to be a time.  He says, "Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation."  To that one – I do not care whether it is me or whether it is some 
        other faithful servant of God – if God gives you something to do, you have to do it.  And he will speak to me things that maybe he won't speak to you, and give maybe revelation to me 
        that I can answer the questions in the hearts of those.  Now we are all receiving revelations from God, and I thank God for it.  If he did not, then you would not be here today.  But 
        it is true and I know where he has set me, and I plan on staying until he takes me out, even if there is just one left.  Amen, to be faithful to God. Here's a good admonition for us.</p>

        (the Assyrians) were just trusting in flesh, but they (the children of Israel) were trusting in the living God. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> With him is an arm of flesh; but 
        with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</strong> In other words, they took 
        confidence and made them not afraid because they knew that God was with them, where the Assyrians, the pagans, were fighting after the flesh, by the arm of flesh.  If we trust in the 
        arm of flesh, we are never going to come to this place in God.  If we think that we are going to come in through the flesh, that is a lot of baloney.  We are going to come in through 
        the Spirit by the revelation of the Spirit as he reveals himself and as he unveils truth after truth to our understanding where, by faith, we can receive and go in.  The children of 
        Israel had to go in by faith too and by obedience, not by what they thought in their minds, but by faith, knowing the Word of God.</p>

        continually sought after his Father to know the will of the Father, knowing who he was, and finally had to openly declare it, when he read the scriptures in the temple, when he said, 
        "This day is the word fulfilled in your ears."  Amen, and that is why they wanted to kill him because he dared to say that he was God's Son.  Now the Word of God says that we are Sons 
        of God.  And I want to tell you something, they will try to kill us when we openly declare we are Sons of God, and yet the scripture is – that is what it is all about, the whole 
        scripture is to bring forth this people in the end time that will go forth and do the work of the Lord.</p>

        going to come back in a flesh body. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God</strong> Not as a spirit out here floating 
        around, but in flesh.  The resurrection is going to bring forth flesh.  It is a reverse action. The minute the last root of sin comes out of our flesh, we are a candidate for eternal life,
        to never die, the change.</p>    
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Because sin is the thing that caused death in the beginning.  Sin is the only thing that kept Adam and Eve from living forever.  That was the curse.  Death was the 
        curse because Satan said to Eve, "Did God say?"  Because of his sin and because of her sin, then their bodies had to be changed to where they could not live.  That was the curse.  
        Death was the curse that was put upon them, along with some other curses.  So God has still not changed his plan from the time he made the first man Adam.  He is going to have that 
        people that is going to walk in the earth and rule and reign as he did with Adam and Eve.  He told them to rule the earth and over the works of his hands, Amen, and to control it and 
        to take care of it, dress it and keep it.  So he still is going to have that people.  He has not changed his mind since he created Adam, just because Adam fell and Eve fell, and he had 
        to give them flesh and blood to keep them alive by blood.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">I do not know how God will cause us to live forever.  I know it is by his Spirit because he is the one who breathes the breath of life into every one of us to begin 
        with, or we would not be alive today.  This is why he says, "Fear not little children, I have overcome the world."  He is talking about overcoming this flesh thing, this flesh body.  
        He overcame, that the way might be made.  When he was on the cross he said, "It is finished."  He had completed that way and the way was made for us to come back into eternal life to 
        where we would never die.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 6</p>    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Do you know the worst thing that everybody faces is aging and dying?  If you do not believe it, you get to be about 25 and start looking in the mirror and you start 
        feeling bad.  Every time you look in the mirror, you look a little worse.  It is because that is that curse.  It was never meant for man to have on him, in the beginning.  It was never 
        made for people to age and become old, or to die.  God made us to live forever, and we are going to live forever whether we die – Jesus made the way – and be resurrected.  For those 
        that will serve him, they will come back in their flesh bodies.  Amen, now it will be flesh and bone not flesh and blood.  Remember that.  I do not understand the change here, although 
        I know we will know one another and all of that, because the Word says so.  And I know that they knew Jesus.  But what the change is, I do not have any idea.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Some of them did recognize him right away.  (Jesus after his resurrection.)  Now whether he had his back to Mary and she thought it was a gardener, but the minute he 
        spoke, she worshipped him.  Like the two men on the way to Emmaus, they did not know who he was, when he was talking with them.  But when he went unto the disciples and Thomas, they 
        knew who he was.  They knew who he was when he walked to them and hollered, "Children, have ye any meat?"  Peter said, "It is the Lord."  And he jumped out of the boat.  He could not 
        wait for the boat to get there, he jumped out and swam to shore.  Amen.  Isn't it good to see somebody love God that much?</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">We were talking about Job. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for 
        myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</strong> Yet he knew that he would see God as he stood in his flesh to look upon him.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 7</p>    

    
    <p class="w3-justify">And I know that I will see God in this flesh, and I will look upon him, Amen.  You see time is running out on God's calendar.  I believe the last war is just about to 
        be, and that is one of the great signs that is coming.  I believe that all of the nations are gathered, and I could not say that during World War II or any of the other wars that I 
        have lived through, through my years.  But I know now that, according to scripture, I believe it is lined up just right.  And I believe most every other Bible student in the world who 
        knows anything about the scriptures will tell you the same thing: that it could happen.  Only God could put it together.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">When that battle starts, this last war, then you are going to see God's people change.  This is why I am anxious.  I want to see us get going, Amen; get rid of this 
        flesh; put this flesh down.  That is the only reason I am teaching this.  The reason I am hanging around is because I look you people over.  I am looking for signs, Amen.  I am looking 
        to see if there are some white hairs missing, that are getting dark, and I look to see if there are some wrinkles gone.  I will know that there is a change taking place.  It is just as 
        natural as can be.  People that really walk with God and are happy all of the time in the Spirit because their consciences are clear, they always look younger.  Haven’t you seen it in 
        Christians?  But you take people that are sinners, they just get worse and wrinkled and they just get all drawn up like an old toad.  It is just awful how people look when they live in 
        sin.  And you can take a person that doesn't know God that is in terrible sin and you see them saved and in ten minutes you will see a change, or maybe quicker than that.  You will see 
        a change in their face, because the Lord of life comes in.  He is our life.  When the Lord of life comes in, it cannot help but make a change on the outside. It just shows.</p>
