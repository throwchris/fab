        shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities</strong> All your sins. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall 
          be builded. And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden 
          of Eden;</strong> Here we are back in the garden of Eden.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become  fenced, and are inhabited. 
            Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do 
            it.</strong> Do not think that we are going to do it.  It is going to be God.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be enquired of 
            by the house of Israel, to do it for them;</strong> We are of the house of Israel. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">I will increase them with men like a flock.</strong> It is not 
            just going to be two or three; it is going to be like a flock, Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall 
            the waste cities be filled with the flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</strong> Praise God for his Word.  And I know where I am going.  Amen.  And I also know 
            who I am.  Praise God. Only by the Spirit shall we know who we are.</p>
            
            
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red">Matthew 16:13-17<strong></strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked 
      his disciples, saying,</strong><strong class="w3-text-red">Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And they said, Some say that thou art John the 
      Baptist:</strong> Looking after the flesh, answering by the flesh. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto 
      them,</strong> <strong class="w3-text-red">But whom say ye that I am?</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the 
      living God.</strong> Now he was looking on a flesh man just like himself, Amen.  When we start seeing flesh bodies coming forth in the image and likeness of Jesus Christ; doing the same 
      works that he has done and even greater works than these; and walking through walls; and appearing where they are not supposed to be, you are going to have to know that there are some 
      Sons that have been born unto God.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And Jesus answered and said unto him,</strong> <strong class="w3-text-red">Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: 
      for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</strong> You cannot see these revelations except the Father reveal them to you by the Spirit.  Peter 
      was looking upon a flesh man, Jesus, that was born in a little town a little ways from where he lived.  He came out of a womb just like he did, and yet he could declare that 'thou art 
      the Christ the Son of the living God'.  He could declare it and know that it was so, because he was not looking after the natural, but he was looking after the Spirit that God had 
      revealed it to him.  He said the time will come when we will not know one another after the flesh but after the Spirit.  Praise God.  I will be glad for that day when we know no longer 
      after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-light-blue">Matthew 16:27-28<strong></strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-red"> For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with 
      his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works. Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man 
      coming in his kingdom.</strong> And there were some of them there that saw Jesus killed and raised from the dead and come back in a glorified body.  They looked upon his glorified body, 
      and that is the kingdom of God.  This is what he was talking about.  There are some of you standing here right now he said, that will not die, but you are going to see my Father's 
      kingdom.  You are going to see the kingdom.  And that is the kingdom, glorified Sons of God.  He was the Son of God, the first one, Amen</p>

      now, right out here.  It is awfully close.  You can almost touch it. <strong class="w3-text-red">For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation 
      which God created unto this time, neither shall be. And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath 
      shortened the days.</strong> Haven't almost every one of us received prophecies saying that you are the elect of God, you have been chosen of God, you have been with God from the 
      foundation of the world, you are called into a special calling and all of that? <strong class="w3-text-red">And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; 
      believe him not: For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.</strong> When they say go here and go 
      there looking for Christ – some man that says, “I am Christ” – he said look inside.  Where are you going to go?  Run off across the country looking for Christ?  He is in here.  When men 
      start rising up and claiming that they have the very thing that this scripture is talking about, and not producing in their flesh the evidence of it, and if they are still walking in the 
      realm of sin, you know they are false Christs. He said there will be many Christs that shall walk the earth as Jesus Christ walked the earth.  There will be many.  And many Sons will be 
      born into the kingdom.</p>

      because there is a war coming.  That isn’t what he is saying.  He is telling us to get ready for the day of the Lord is at hand.  This will be the day of the Lord. 
      <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; 
      there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations</strong> There will never be, even though there are many generations, there 
      will never be another people like this people that he is getting ready to prepare. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">A fire devoureth before them;</strong> By the power of God, just 
      like the fire consumed – when Elijah called down fire from heaven. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the 
      garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them. The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses;</strong> That is the 
      strength <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and as horsemen, so shall they run.</strong> Amen, to conquer.  A horse in the day that this was written, there was no other way of conveyance 
      but through horses, one way or another, and they were strong.  They always stand for strength in the scriptures. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Like the noise of chariots on the tops 
      of mountains shall they leap,</strong> He is talking about this people now. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong

      <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break

        thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.</strong> Think of it.  You stick a sword in you now, you will find 
        out what comes out.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter 
        in at the windows like a thief.</strong> I mean God's people are going to be everywhere.  Amen, and they will go as fast as a thought to where God sends them by the Spirit. The earth 
        shall quake before them; You think he is not preparing a people, us little no good nothings sitting back here?  Do you realize what call he is calling a people to? 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining: And the 
        Lord shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can 
        abide it?</strong> Amen, you talk about a people like we have never seen or has never been on the earth before.  Do you remember that Adam, how he had such wisdom, that he even named 
        every creature upon the earth; he gave them names.  And how he lived in that beautiful realm, and the dominion that he had?  If he wanted to say to a lion, he would say 'come here', or 
        whatever his language was, and it would have to obey, because he had dominion and rule over that thing.  And so when he sends a people, his army, forth with such power and 
        might.</p>

      is impossible: absolutely impossible.  You have to seek God, and you have to let him speak to you through the Word as you study the Word.  That is the way the revelation comes.  Amen, 
      now you can receive revelation through teaching too, but not like when you hear it from the Lord, when suddenly you look on the scripture, and it is like a light bulb turns on, and you 
      see what he is saying.  Amen.  That is the revelation of the Spirit.</p>

      for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</strong> Remember we are trying to find out what kind of body we are going to have.  He had flesh and bone, the same as Adam had 
      in the beginning, flesh and bone, a body that could not die. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. And while they yet 
      believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them,</strong> <strong class="w3-text-red">Have ye here any meat?</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And they gave him a piece 
      of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. And he took it, and did eat before them.</strong> Don't you think that blew their minds?  My Lord, he is eating.  Do you think the world is not 
      going to look at amazement at us, praise God, walk through a wall and then go in the cupboard and get something to eat?  Well praise God, that is what it says.</p>

      his Sons all the way through.  This is where Paul got his revelation.  There was not any New Testament then.  There were several books of the Old Testament on a scroll, and that is where 
      he got it, the whole message that Paul taught. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, And said unto 
      them,</strong> <strong class="w3-text-red">Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remission of sins 
      should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things. And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the 
      city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</strong> When Jesus was resurrected from the dead, I do not think he had completely received the glory of the Father.  He 
      was a resurrected being.  He supernaturally came out of the grave, but evidently there was a work yet, that no putrid horrible flesh could dare touch him, lest he be contaminated for 
      some reason.  That is my own theory of it when he said, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended unto my Father."  He had just come out of the grave but he had a work to complete.</p>

      little persecution, and you bawl and squall, because you hurt so bad, because you have done something you should not do, whatever, and God has laid his hand on that thing.  He says that
