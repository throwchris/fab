    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">I have found a ransom.</strong> Or an atonement for sin. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">His flesh shall be fresher than a 
        child's: he shall return to the days of his youth: He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his 
        righteousness. He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; He will deliver his soul from going into the 
        pit,</strong> Or into death. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and his life shall see the light.</strong> This life. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Lo, all these things worketh 
        God oftentimes with man, To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</strong> Amen. God's Spirit works on this flesh or grass. </p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red">Isaiah 40:1-8<strong></strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.</strong> 
        Do you know what I just felt the Spirit say to me? Since the fall of Adam, God has tried to get man to see this message. He just spoke that to me.  He said he has tried to get man to 
        see this message since the fall of Adam and man will not receive it.  Think of it.  The Lord is sitting back and waiting for somebody to come along that will receive his Word and 
        believe it.  Since Adam fell, God has tried to bring man back by his Word.</p> 
        
        <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 9</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">What a hope we have.  If we were reading this out of a newspaper or something, we could doubt it, but we are reading the Word of God, the very Word of God.  We do not 
        need to die.  All we have to do is walk after the Spirit and let the Spirit work with our hearts to keep removing these old roots, these old decayed things in us of the natural flesh, 
        and walk in the Spirit, to walk in the Spirit, Amen.  He has promised us that he will rid us of this nature.  That is what he died for, that the Adamic nature that we are born with, 
        every child is born with, in the earth, under the curse.  Every child that is born has this nature and these roots of sin.  And when that is taken out, when God has removed the roots 
        of sin, then look out, because then it can happen, Amen.  We can be changed.  Amen.  That is his Word, and we have to believe his Word or else we do not even have salvation, if we do 
        not believe his Word.  Because the same Word that tells us this, tells us of salvation. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.</strong>
        Look at how he is with us.  He wants us to be comforted, and all we want to do is slam one another over the head and condemn one another because there is a little mistake or something 
        in us, when God is doing his best to work with us to try to get us to get rid of this thing in us, these things of sin, oh whatever it might be, temper, lust – who cares – stealing, 
        whatever it is, God is big enough to do it.  Christ overcame it so that we could overcome, Amen.  And if somebody is going through a hard trial, let's not fight them.  Let's help them, 
        Amen.  He said 'lest ye be tempted also'.  So if you see something in yourself, do not hide it.  The best way in the world to get rid of something that is in you is to say, "Do you know 
        what I have?  I have a terrible temptation of lust and I want the body to pray for me."  You see it says 'there is no temptation that has come upon man that is not common to man'.  
        Everyone has been through the same temptation.  You are no different than anybody else.  Do not be ashamed of it.  Get rid of it.  Take it before the Lord.  Amen.  Let him pull that 
        thing out.  We cannot get rid of it.  You cannot get rid of it.  I could not get rid of it.  Whatever it was, temper, you name it.  It comes out by praying to the Father, and to 
        recognize it, asking God to deliver you from it.  And he will deliver you.  He is anxious to deliver us.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem,</strong> Now he is not talking to the city, 
        Jerusalem.  He is talking to us.  We are the New Jerusalem. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, </strong> This is a continual 
        warfare.  And in the Book of Romans, it tells us about the warfare that is going on in us between the flesh and the Spirit.  It is a real warfare. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">
        that her iniquity</strong> Or sin <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">is pardoned: for she hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins.</strong> We have suffered, Amen, 
        for the sins that we have committed and God wants to forgive us and remove them from us.  It is time to be cleansed, Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> The voice of him that 
        crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain</strong></p> 
   

    <p class="w3-justify">We should be saying this.  Prepare the way of the Lord and tell the people, "Make straight the paths.  God is able to take you through.  There is no need to fall back 
        into sin.  He is the deliverer."  Now every one of us that is serving God, you know very well that there were things in your life before, that you are not bothered with anymore.  
        Where do you think they went?  God is the deliverer.  Why fight with it?  If God lays it on your heart that something is sin, then talk to him about it.  Ask him to take it out of 
        there.  You do not want it.  You are sick of it.  You are tired of it.  And he will deliver you from it.  So we need to comfort one another.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue">
        Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:</strong> Now we know he is not talking 
        about going up and down hills.  He is talking about that valley of depression you get into, Amen.  You are really down in the valley and the next day you are up here high on the 
        mountain.  But look what his promise is. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Every valley shall be exalted,</strong> Or lifted up. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and every 
        mountain and hill shall be made low:</strong> We are going to be walking on an even keel by the Spirit.  We are going to be walking on a level plane. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">
        and the crooked shall be made straight,</strong> This is the way we walk as Christians; in and out.  And the rough places that we have to go through are going to be made plain.  
        Now Christ made that way for us, if we can accept it.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for 
        the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</strong> Do you believe that?  It is the Word of God.  This is after we learn to walk in the straight path of the Lord, and walk in righteousness 
        on the earth.  Amen.  Then what happens?  The next verse <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,</strong> Isn’t that beautiful, and plain, and 
        clear to us?  And God has promised that it would be made. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Every valley shall be</strong> Lifted up <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">exalted, and 
        every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight,</strong> He said it shall be. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and the rough places plain: And the 
        glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry?</strong> Now 
        this was a prophet. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:</strong> What is this flesh to God?  It is like 
        a blade of grass.  Do you think he is going to have any problem changing that flesh?  Of course not. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because 
        the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.</strong></p>

        corruptible.  He is talking about living flesh people that have just purified their souls in obeying the truth by the Spirit. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Being born 
        again,</strong> Now he is not talking about salvation because they have already obeyed the truth. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">not of corruptible seed,</strong> Being born again 
        not of corruptible seed, which we were, of the Adam nature <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</strong> 
        There is a new birth that is going to take place.  I have taught that before.  There is a new birth that is going to take place, yet.  Do you remember the words - three - God the 
        Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost: everything is in threes.  That is the complete number in God.  And we know that there is another work.  We have salvation.  We have the 
        baptism of the Holy Ghost.  There is another work to be done by the Spirit and that is that birthing, that birthing, that change that will come forth in our flesh, Amen, that will 
        bring us into immortality, or an incorruptible body. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Being born again, not of corruptible seed,</strong> We were born – the first, our flesh 
        birth – we were born in corruption.  In sin and corruption we were born, after the Adam seed of nature.  That was our first birth.  Then we are forgiven for our sin in salvation, 
        but now he says <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Being born again, not of corruptible seed,</strong> Which we were in our first birth, of a hopeless state of sin 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</strong> This is going to be a work of the Spirit that changes us from 
        the corruptible being into the incorruptible.  It says that Jesus' body, speaking of his death, should not see corruption, that his body would not rot and decay.  That is the natural 
        way of flesh – to die and rot.  Death brings corruption and rottenness and that is what will happen to every one of us if we do not go the way of the Spirit, because that is the way it 
        is.  It is just the way of flesh.  But if you want to go the way of the Spirit, that will never happen to you.  You will be changed in the twinkling of an eye, the scripture says.  And 
        this body of corruption shall put on incorruption and we will be changed.  That is scripture too.  We are going to read this again. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Being born 
        again,</strong> So there is a new birth, another birth that has to take place by the Spirit in us <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">not of corruptible seed, but of 
        incorruptible,</strong> Through the Spirit <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever, </strong>This incorruptible seed cannot be 
        destroyed.  But the corruptible seed, which is our flesh, will die, but if we put on incorruption, we cannot die.  It is just that simple.  It is impossible to die if you put on that 
        incorruption; the same as it was impossible for Christ to die again because his body did not see corruption, but it was changed.  It was just changed.  And this is what we will do.  
        We will never die, but we will just be changed according to the Word of God.  Not according to what I say, but according to the Word of God. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">
        For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man</strong> Anything, no matter what man can do, it is <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, 
        and the flower thereof falleth away: But the word of the Lord</strong> Which we are going to live by. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">endureth for ever.</strong> It cannot be 
        destroyed.  We will be living by the Word of God and he becomes our life. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.</strong> I 
        know there was a point in my life when the Lord said that you live no more because of your flesh, but Jesus said to me, "You live because I live."  And that was a shocker to me, and it 
        was very hard for me to accept, to know that this life that I live right now, I am not living because I am eating potatoes and bread.  Amen.  But I am living because God has chosen to 
        keep me alive, to bring a people into everlasting life.  Not that he loves me more than he loves anybody else, but it is a call that God has put upon my life, to bring a people into 
        everlasting life without death, that we will never see death.  Amen.  Isn't that a great thing?</p>

        but he is going to take the whole thing out, praise God, and give you a brand new spirit heart.  Praise God, a glorified flesh heart.  Praise God.  I do not know what it is going to do 
        because it sure is not going to pump blood.  I think he is speaking here of the seat of man, not the real heart.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue">That they may walk in my

        wouldn’t we?  We have to believe it just like we did for salvation or for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.  Although the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a little different because he does 
        give an evidence by speaking in tongues.  That is a little easier to believe when that tongue breaks forth.  But salvation you just receive by faith.  And by faith, you are going to

        death from lack of the Spirit, Amen, but we will flourish.  We will grow fat.  You fatten hogs on corn.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And I will multiply the fruit of the 
        tree,</strong> And we are trees; your fruit is going to come forth.  He calls us trees of righteousness.  The fruit is going to start showing.  You know what the fruits are.  Remember 
        how he cursed the fig tree because it did not have any fruit on it.  He will do the same with us – as if we are one of those trees walking around out here. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.</strong>
        It is a reproach to not walk godly when the Word of God says that we should walk godly before him.  All of these promises in the Word.  No wonder the heathen looks at us, and that is 
        the unsaved in the world out here, and says, "Boy, you are a bunch of nothings."  They do not see the results. People are sitting bored to death in the churches, not hearing this 
        beautiful message of the kingdom.  I want to tell you, the message of the kingdom is going to go forth because the Lord says, when the message of the kingdom is preached in all the 
        world for a testimony unto him, then shall the end come.  This is the message of the kingdom, in case you do not know, his kingdom on the earth that will be fulfilled through people 
        dwelling in these beautiful bodies that will rule and reign; unlimited power in God in righteousness. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Then shall ye remember your own evil 
        ways,</strong> You will look back and see how we walked. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your 
        iniquities and for your abominations.</strong> After we have come into that place and looked back and say, "Oh my, my, my, how did God ever put up with us?"</p>
